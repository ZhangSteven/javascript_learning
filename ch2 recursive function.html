/*
The problem: starting with number 1, the perform an operation in
each step:
	1. Add by 5, Or
	2. Multiply by 3.

Given a target number, work out a sequence of operations that results
in the target number. Say the target is 13, then the sequence is

	1*3 + 5 + 5

We can use recursive function to search all possible branches to solve
the problem.

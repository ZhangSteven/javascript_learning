<!-- Register a handler for the window -->
<p>Click this document to activate the handler.</p>


<!-- 
	Register a handler for event 'mouseover' for a paragraph via 
	attribute 'onmouseover'. We can register handlers for other
	events via 'onclick', 'onmousedown', etc.
	
	The browser will call the handler with an event object, which
	contains information about the event, such as event.target (the
	node on which the event is triggered).

	If we specify onmouseover="logEvent()", then the event object will be
	ignored when calling the function. So if we need the event object, 
	then put onmouseover="logEvent(event)" instead.
-->
<p id="testPara1" onmouseover="logEvent(event)">Try this paragraph</p>


<!-- 
	Propogation 

	For most event types, handlers registered on nodes with children will
	also receive events that happen in the children. If a button inside a
	paragraph gets clicked, event handlers on the paragraph will also see
	the click event.

	But if both the button and the paragraph have a handler, the more specific
	handler -- the one on the button -- gets to go first. The event is said
	to propagate outward, from the node where it happened to that node's
	parent node and on to the root of the document. Finally, after all handlers
	registered on a specific node have their turn, handlers registered on
	the whole window get a chance to respond to the event.
-->

<p onmousedown="logParaMouse()">click me anyway you want
	<button id="buttonTest" onmousedown="logMouse(event)">Magic Button</button>
</p>


<!-- Put a single handler on the parent node to handle events on
	sub nodes, i.e., the list of buttons in this case. -->
<div id="divTest" onclick="divClick(event)">
	<p>Click any of the buttons below</p>
	<button id="buttonA">Do A</button>
	<button id="buttonB">Do B</button>
	<button id="buttonC">Do C</button>
</div>


<!-- Default Actions 
	For some events, we can add our own event listeners and prevent the
	default action to happen, such as clicking on URL link. 
-->
<p>Try this link:
	<a id="strangeLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">strange link</a>
</p>


<!-- key events -->
<div id="divTest2">
	<p>Press 'v' to see what happens.</p>
	<p>Press 'Ctrl + i' to continue.</p>
